    "### Getting Started with EDA: Graphing Libraries\n",
    "Within Python, there are typically two graphing libraries that are most commonly used: `Plotly` and `Seaborn`. The benefit of using `Plotly` is that it's quite interactive however `Seaborn` (which in its backend uses the graphing library `Matplotlib`) is used by more Machine Learning Engineers, Data Scientists and Bioinformaticians. Personally, I like to use `Plotly` more often for the interactiveness however, feel free to play around with both and use whichever you prefer.\n",
