# Machine Learning Seminar Activity
### Introduction: 
For the Machine Learning Seminar, we will provide an optional activity for you to complete while the course is ongoing. This activity could theoretically be completed by those of all coding backgrounds and will be available in both Python and R. Within this activity, we will provide 3 real-life bioinformatics-based datasets (1 for classification and 2 for regression) where you will be able to learn how to go through the entire machine learning pipeline of cleaning/preprocessing your data, performing exploratory data analysis, splitting your data into training/testing sets, choosing your model(s),  training your model(s), predicting on the test set, choosing the correct metric to use, and, most importantly, explaining what your results mean. 

As a guide, there will be short coding snippets and guided questions to help push you in the right direction if youâ€™re stuck along with links to online resources if you are in need of more assistance. Additionally, we plan to have short, hour-long meetings every other Wednesday (location and time TBA) where students can meet/discuss in person and where members of the Division of Applied Bioinformatics will be available for individual help. If you are unable to attend these Wednesday meetings or if you need more urgent assistance, these four Division of Applied Bioinformatics members (Roma Kurilov, Ralitsa Langova, Nicholas Abad, and Oscar Velasco Gonzalez) will also be available via email.

At the end of the Machine Learning Seminar, we are also planning a final meeting (date, location and time TBA)  where those students who have participated will come to talk about their results, what they liked, what they found difficult, and most importantly discuss with their classmates why certain methods worked/did not work. No presentation will be required and we envision this to be a more open discussion rather than an actual presentation. We highly encourage all participants to come to this!

### Goal:
With this activity, our goals are the following:
- Implement the machine learning algorithms (i.e. linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks, etc.) that you have learned throughout the seminar using either Python and/or R
- Use real bioinformatics-based datasets to perform your analysis
- Perform an entire machine learning analysis starting from having only data available all the way to presenting your results in a clear and concise manner
- Collaborate with other students to see what works and/or does not work

# Getting Started
Before doing any work, it's extremely common for machine learning engineers, data scientists, and bioinformaticians to use some type of version control. Without getting into too much details, it's a way for users to "load in" someone's previous coding repository so that they can make changes or use it as a default starting point. In our case, we will be using GitHub but there are other alternatives such as GitLab, Bitbucket, Google Cloud Source Repositories, and AWS CodeCommit but thankfully, they all work the same way. If you are unaware of what version control does, feel free to watch this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjZcfj8yxE&ab_channel=ColtSteele

### Downloading Git
If you do not yet have Git installed, follow the directions to do so here: https://git-scm.com/downloads

### Cloning the Repository
Now, open your terminal in your respective operating system and ensure that git is properly installed by typing:

`git --help`

Different git options should be displayed such as `clone`, `init`, `add`, `merge`, etc.

Now, navigate to the proper location in your computer that you want to save your work in (i.e. /Desktop/) and clone (or load in/copy) this current repository that we have by inputting the following command:

`git clone https://github.com/nicholas-abad/ml-seminar-activity.git`

If everything works properly, a new folder should be created in the location where you want to save your work and this folder should be called `ml-seminar-activity`. Ensure that this is the case before proceeding!

### Option 1: Using Python / Jupyter Notebooks
If you'd like to continue doing this activity using Python, ensure that you have both Python 3.xx, pip and Jupyter Notebook installed. Before starting the installation process, `pip` is a way to programatically download the different ML libraries that we'll be using using such as Pandas, NumPy, SciKit Learn and Keras/Tensorflow. On the other hand, `Jupyter Notebooks` are a common way to run Python commands in a code-block fashion. Luckily, `Jupyter Notebook` can be installed via `pip`.

To download `pip`, follow the directions here: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/download-and-install-pip-latest-version/

Once this is downloaded properly, install `Jupyter Notebooks` by inputting the following command into your terminal/command line:

`pip install notebook`

After this step is complete and wihtin your terminal/command line, navigate to where this repository is saved and type in `jupyter notebook`. If all things work out properly, a new window will pop up. Within this window, click and open the file that ends in the common jupyter notebook file ending `.ipynb` and follow the directions.


### Option 2: Using R / R Markdown Files
